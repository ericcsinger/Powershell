# powershell_vmware_Get-ECSESXHostVIBToPCIDevices
This function allows you to match ultimately match a VIB to a PCI devices.  This will allow you to check if your drivers are up to date.

NOTE 1:  I've only been able to get this to work in ESXi 6.0 and above.  
NOTE 2:  This is using VMware's Get-ESXCLI v1 NOT v2.
