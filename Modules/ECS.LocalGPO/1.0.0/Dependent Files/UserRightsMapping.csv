SeDenyInteractiveLogonRight,Deny local logon,Prohibits a user or group from logging on locally at the keyboard.
SeUndockPrivilege,Remove computer from docking station,Allows a user of a portable computer to unlock the computer by clicking Eject PC on the Start menu.
SeManageVolumePrivilege,Perform volume maintenance tasks,"This policy setting determines which users can perform volume or disk management tasks, such as defragmenting an existing volume, creating or removing volumes, and running the Disk Cleanup tool."
SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight,Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services,This policy setting determines which users or groups can access the logon screen of a remote computer through a Remote Desktop Services connection.

If this user right is required for this type of impersonation, an unauthorized user cannot cause a client to connect (for example, by remote procedure call (RPC) or named pipes) to a service that they have created to impersonate that client. (Such an action could elevate the unauthorized user's permissions to administrative or system levels.)"
SeCreateGlobalPrivilege,Create global objects,This policy setting determines which users can create global objects that are available to all sessions. Users can still create objects that are specific to their own session if they do not have this user right.
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege,Increase a process working set,"This policy setting determines which users can increase or decrease the size of the working set of a process. The working set of a process is the set of memory pages currently visible to the process in physical RAM. These pages are resident, and they are available for an application to use without triggering a page fault. The minimum and maximum working set sizes affect the virtual memory paging behavior of a process."
SeTimeZonePrivilege,Change the time zone,"This policy setting determines which users can adjust the time zone that is used by the computer for displaying the local time, which includes the computer's system time plus the time zone offset."
SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege,Create symbolic links,This user right determines if users can create a symbolic link from the computer they are logged on to.
SeMachineAccountPrivilege,Add workstations to domain,"This policy setting determines which users can add a device to a specific domain.
